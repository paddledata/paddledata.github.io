title: Predictive maintenance based on track geometry measurements
project-date: 2015
client: (Leading railway operator in Germany) | SAP
role: Data Scientist
description: undefined
achievements: <> Coordinated the technical requirements gathering, validation and refinement.<br><br><> Developed the key technical components of the solution:<ul><li>the data integration adapter for binary data (originating from linear track geometry measurements)</li><li>the offset-optimized alignment solution (that allowed matching measurements to real-world geometry)</li><li>the predictive component (indicating the expected time-to-failure and the confidence intervals)</li></ul>
